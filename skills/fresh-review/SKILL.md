# Fresh Review Command

This command helps you review your changes with a fresh perspective using a systematic verification approach.

## Purpose

Provides a structured methodology for reviewing work to catch errors, verify completeness, and ensure quality standards are met.

## Review Process

### 1. Check the Directory Structure

```bash
ls -la /path/to/target/directory/
```

### 2. Verify Contents of Key Files

```bash
cat important_file.md
```

### 3. Systematic Verification Checklist

- **Directory Structure**: Verify all expected files and directories exist
- **File Contents**: Confirm content matches requirements
- **Links/References**: Ensure all internal references are correct
- **Functionality**: Test that implemented features work as expected
- **Error Prevention**: Check for potential issues or inconsistencies
- **Completeness**: Verify nothing is missing from the implementation

### 4. Fresh Perspective Questions

- Does this solve the original problem completely?
- Are there any edge cases I missed?
- Is the implementation maintainable and clear?
- Did I follow all the project conventions?
- Are there any potential security or performance concerns?

## Usage

Use `/fresh-review` when you want to systematically review your work with a fresh perspective. This is especially useful after completing complex tasks or before submitting work.

## Best Practices

- Take a short break before using this review process
- Approach the work as if someone else wrote it
- Verify each requirement against the actual implementation
- Test functionality if applicable
- Double-check all references and links
