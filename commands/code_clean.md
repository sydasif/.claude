Act as a Code Janitor. Perform a deep cleanup:

- Remove unused imports, dead functions, and stale variables.
- Delete commented-out code.
- Fix formatting and simple linting errors.
- **Do not** change logic or architecture.
- Ensure code adheres to style guidelines (e.g., PEP 8 for Python).
- Provide a summary of changes made after cleanup.
